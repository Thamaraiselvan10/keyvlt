**KeyVlt is a modern, open-source platform for sharing files securely and effortlessly. Instead of long, cryptic URLs, KeyVlt uses simple, memorable key-names to grant access to your content.**

Upload a file, create a unique key-name like `project-kickoff-docs`, and share it. It's that simple. KeyVlt is designed for teachers, students, professionals, and anyone who needs a fast and controlled way to distribute documents.
